# Performance notes and required packages

AARMBEM.jl has been written in Julia. It has been tested in Julia
1.0. It requires the modules `LinearAlgebra`, `DelimitedFiles`,
`SharedArrays`, `SpecialFunctions`, `Distributed`, and `Printf`.

AARMBEM.jl has been written with parallelism in mind. In particular,
the functions for assembling the Green's function matrices make use of
parallel for-loops. However, while the programs in AARMBEM.jl may be
invoked using parallel processing via a command like `julia -p N`
(followed by the command as well as any arguments) for a number of
processes `N` larger than 1, testing thus far has showed this to be
somewhat unreliable on certain setups. Therefore, it is recommended
that `N` be set to 1, and that parallelism be done instead over
frequencies (and Bloch wavevectors, if appropriate), as that process
can be done in an embarrassingly parallel manner (i.e. with each set
of frequencies (and Bloch wavevectors, if appropriate) constituting a
single job). This is particularly suitable for use in a script,
especially one that interfaces with a job scheduler like SLURM.
