# Historical background

The RMB framework, of which AARMBEM.jl is a computational
implementation, was originally developed as an extension of the
many-body dispersion (MBD) framework for computing van der Waals (vdW)
interaction energies. The details of this page can be found in work by
Venkataram et al [^VenkataramARXIV2020]; this page simply summarizes
the key points.

The MBD framework was developed to compute ground state vdW
interaction energies in atoms and in molecular systems of many
different sizes, combining ab-initio accounts of local chemical
changes to electron densities in bonded atoms relative to free atoms
[^TkatchenkoPRL2009] with Coulomb potentials coupling each atom to
account for long-range interactions [^TkatchenkoPRL2012]. It has been
applied to small dimers, clusters of silicon or carbon, carbon
allotropes, biological molecules, organic molecular crystals, and many
other systems in order to determine binding energies, structural
properties, vibrational spectra, and other properties.
