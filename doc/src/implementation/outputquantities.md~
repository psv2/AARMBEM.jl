# Output quantities in AARMBEM.jl

AARMBEM.jl only outputs dimensionless integrands. It does not perform
any integrations over frequency (or over Bloch wavevector, if
present).

For compact molecular bodies, AARMBEM.jl only requires the
frequency. For vdW interaction free energies, it outputs the integrand
``f(\mathrm{i}\xi)``. For thermal radiation powers, it outputs
one-fourth of the spectrum, namely ``\frac{1}{4} \Phi^{(m)}_{n}
(\omega)``, without any factors of the Planck function.
